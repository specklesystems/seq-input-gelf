## Introduction

This repository contains a Helm Chart for deploying [DataLust's `seq-input-gelf`](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/using-gelf#enabling-gelf-in-docker) Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.

If deploying `seq-input-gelf` alongside `seq`, please use DataLust's [official Helm Chart](https://github.com/datalust/helm.datalust.co/tree/main/charts/seq). This Helm Chart allows `seq-input-gelf` to be deployed independently of `seq`.

You may wish to deploy `seq-input-gelf` if you are exporting logs in Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF).

You may wish to deploy `seq-input-gelf` independently of `seq` if you have a multiple Kubernetes clusters, and wish to transfer log data from a source cluster to a target cluster, running `seq`. Alternatively, you may have `seq` deployed on a non-Kubernetes environment, and wish to export logs messages from Kubernetes to that external seq instance.

This project or repository is in no way affiliated with DataLust or Seq.

## Documentation

### Usage

1. You will require [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) and access to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster to which you have appropriate permissions to deploy resources.
1. Clone this repository and in a shell terminal, `cd` in to the root directory of the cloned repository.
1. Run the following command to create a secret containing your deployment key, replacing `YOURAPIKEY` with an [API key generated by your Seq instance](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/api-keys):

   ```shell
   kubectl create secret generic seq-api-key --from-value=api-key=YOURAPIKEY --namespace seq-input-gelf
   ```

1. Add the helm repository for this Helm Chart

   ```shell
   helm repo add seq-input-gelf https://specklesystems.github.io/seq-input-gelf/stable
   ```

1. Update the value of `seq.url` in `./examples/values.yaml` file to match the url of your seq instance. The default example assumes seq is hosted within the same Kubernetes cluster with a Service named `seq` within a namespace named `seq`. Please adjust this as required.

1. Run the following command to install the helm chart in your kubernetes cluster. Note that this will create a new namespace named `seq-input-gelf`:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade seq-input-gelf \
   seq-input-gelf/seq-input-gelf \
   --create-namespace \
   --namespace seq-input-gelf \
   --install \
   --values ./examples/values.yaml
   ```

1. Verify that the deployment has successfully [rolled out](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#deployment-status):

   ```shell
   kubectl rollout status deployment/seq-input-gelf --namespace seq-input-gelf
   ```

### Developing & Debugging

1. Ensure the Helm chart can be templated:

   ```shell
   helm template seq-input-gelf ./charts/seq-input-gelf
   ```
